# IntelliQuiz

Welcome to the IntelliQuiz project! This repository contains the backend code for an AI-powered quiz application that generates, evaluates, and provides hints based on user inputs. The project uses GROQ for intelligent quiz generation and evaluation, delivering a personalized learning experience for users.

For fast quiz retrieval and caching, Redis is employed to ensure efficient performance, particularly during frequent quiz fetches and evaluations. Additionally, NodeMailer is used to send users detailed quiz scores and performance reviews directly to their inbox, enhancing the feedback loop.
